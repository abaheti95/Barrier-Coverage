# Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Network
Wireless sensor networks are used a lot these days for monitoring, exploration and surveillance activities across the world. Different applications require different coverage schemes. Among all the various coverage schemes, Barrier Coverage is gaining a lot of populatrity these days. It is mainly used in intrusion detection in a belt region. Usually these wireless sensors are deployed in an unknown area via air drop. Thus getting a barrier coverage with a random deployment becomes difficult. In this project we assume sensors to be mobile and dynamically construct 1-barrier coverage after the random deployment of sensors.
